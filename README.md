HotSpotter helps geographically pinpoint the physical broadcast source of a WiFi network in the area. 

The back-end code is loaded onto a Particle Photon, which links an Android application developed via Porter. You are first able to see a list of all visible WiFi networks in the area, and select the one you want to track. As you move the Photon around, the signal strength of the selected network is read on the app in real-time, allowing you to find the physical broadcast source of the network.

Placed Top 10, won MLH Best Device Privacy Hack award, won 1517 Keep Building award @ HackTX 2016.
